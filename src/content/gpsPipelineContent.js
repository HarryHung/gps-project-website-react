During GPS2, a portable pipeline named GPS Pipeline is being developed which will enable collaborators to easily input whole genome sequencing data and generate the *in silico* typing data required for downstream analysis. Although the pipeline is still under active development, its latest version is available on GitHub for testing: [https://github.com/sanger-bentley-group/gps-pipeline/](https://github.com/sanger-bentley-group/gps-pipeline/)"
