As such, a key focus of the second phase of the GPS project (GPS2) is to establish a sustainable genomic surveillance system with an emphasis on decentralisation of data generation and analysis, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the burden of pneumococcal disease is high. In view of the variation in local infrastructure and resources, we devises bespoke support for project partners to cater for different needs in sequencing, training and mentorship.',

            quotes: ["The participation in the GPS project was an experience analysing WGS data and meeting the challenge of handling a large volume of data. The GPS team made a great effort to help me with the analysis and to address difficulties. In my opinion, it is a project that goes far beyond data generation, as there is a real effort to build capacity by sharing knowledge and providing bioinformatics training. During my participation, I received many incentives to develop studies and opportunities to present these results. I presented abstracts in the most important pneumococcus international events, the International Symposium on Pneumococcal and Pneumococcal Diseases (ISPPD), Australia (2018), and Toronto (2020) editions."]

That was really amazing. Added to the human warmth of each of them that also allowed us to share beautiful moments drinking a beer in the pubs of Hinxton and Cambridge.", "From there, a very important link was generated. I worked a lot with Steph, whom I thank for the recognition and respect for our work and for answering all my questions immediately. Working with such a prestigious group of experts with the highest level of responsibility gives us the confidence to do other works in the future."]

Nida obtained an 8 months research fellowship funded by Higher Education Commission in Pakistan and joined the Bentley group the Wellcome Sanger Institute for hands-on training in genomic analyses of *S. pneumoniae*. Unfortunately, Nida's arrival coincided with the UK national lockdown and the switch to working from home. Despite these challenges, Nida quickly integrated with the team, and learnt how to apply key tools used for characterising the genomic epidemiology of pneumococci to datasets from South Africa and Pakistan. Dr. Stephanie Lo is Nida's main mentor and together they made a great mentor-mentee team. As the lockdown restrictions started easing, Nida started having weekly in-person meetings with Stephanie, and joined occasional get-togethers with other team members."

However, due to the lockdown, sequencing of isolates from Pakistan was delayed and I started working on the country analysis of pneumococcal carriage isolates from South Africa. I started with running quality control analysis of the sequenced data, followed by *in silico* serotyping, genotyping, prediction of antimicrobial resistance and phylogenetic analysis from pneumococcal genomes using a wide range of command-line tools such as SeroBA and PopPUNK. I then visualized the output using Microreact, a tool that allows me to interactively explore the phylogeny with temporal and geographical data. Now almost a year and a half later, this manuscript is ready for submission. I would like to thank Dr. Shabbir Madhi for allowing me to work on his dataset.", "After a few months, pneumococcal isolates from Pakistan were sequenced. I then analysed these data using the approach and tools that I had learnt during my first few months at Sanger, and am working towards publication of my Pakistan country analysis. We also presented our preliminary results at the ABPHM online conference. Although I am back in Pakistan now, I am still actively working with Stephanie and attend the team meetings regularly. I would like to thank Stephen, Stephanie, and the team for their support and kindness. I would also like to thank my PhD advisor, Dr. Shaper Mirza, for her support and guidance through my PhD."]
