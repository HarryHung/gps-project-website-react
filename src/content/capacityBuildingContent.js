A key focus of the second phase of the GPS project (GPS2) is to establish a working system for sustainable genomic surveillance with an emphasis on decentralization of data generation and analysis, especially in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) where the burden of pneumococcal disease is high. In view of variation in local infrastructure and resources, the GPS project devises bespoke support for project partners to cater for different needs in sequencing, training and mentorship.',

Our plans for an in person bioinformatics workshop are currently on hold due to the pandemic. However, free [online training](https://training.bactgen.sanger.ac.uk/) resources have been developed by the GPS and JUNO training manager Christine Boinett. We aim to deploy a face-to-face or virtual format 5 day bioinformatics course to supplement the online courses in partnership with colleagues from [Wellcome Connecting Science](https://www.wellcomeconnectingscience.org/) (WCS). [Other FREE courses](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/wellcome-genome-campus) from WCS, in partnership with FutureLearn are currently available online for anyone to take in their own time. Some of these courses offer [continuing professional development](https://cpduk.co.uk/explained) (CPD) credits.'
