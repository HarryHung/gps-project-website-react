          content: "Top Trumps is a card game where each card in the deck features a character or object from a theme with a set of statistics. Players take turns picking a category from their top card to compare against the same category on their opponent's top card. The key to winning is choosing categories where you believe that your card has the highest value. The player with the highest value in the chosen category wins both cards and adds them to their pile. The game continues until one player collects all the cards or the deck runs out.",

The numerical categories are based on real statistics, including the number of samples of each GPSC in the global database, the number of countries where the GPSC has been found, the number of serotypes within the GPSC, and the recombination rate. For the images, we collaborated with our global GPS partners, who contributed artwork representing each GPSC.',
